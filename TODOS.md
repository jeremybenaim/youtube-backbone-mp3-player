## Todos

- switch to react views (?)
- re-architecture the models and views because Jeremy Ashkenas would kick my ass if he saw this
- add other streaming sources supported by youtube-dl
- get duration (in tracks.json?) to increment the elapsedTime div width value on updateTimer
- error handling (for failing spawned process among others)
- cross-fade between songs (create new Audio then smoothPause audio A when audio B canplay event is fired)
- a lot of other stuff I guess, but who's reading that anyway :)
